I am a PhD student in the [Signal Processing and Communication Laboratory](http://sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at [University of Cambridge](http://cam.ac.uk). I am supervised by [Professor Sumeetpal Singh](http://sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/SSS40).

Before starting my PhD, I was an undergraduate student reading [BEng Mechnical Engineering ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mechanical-engineering-department/mechanical-engineering-meng/)at [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). I received my first Master degree in [MSc Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/msc-mathematical-modelling-and-scientific-computing) at [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk),[](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)while being a member of [St Cross College](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk), [University of Oxford](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I received my second Master degree in [MSc Risk and Stochastics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MSc-Quantitative-Methods-for-Risk-Management) at [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics), [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

My current research interests are Bayesian Computation and Bayesian Machine Learning.
